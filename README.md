This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.
> This isntruction is only for iOS and Mac users. Android users, check above link to setup or run the code.

## Steps: 

sync the project by running this command:
- git clone https://github.com/subbir/HomeAutomation.git
  
Navigate to the Folder name HomeAutomation

run this command to download react native libs and node module dependencies:
- npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack react-native-safe-area-context --save


### For iOS

Navigate to ios folder
run this command: 
- pod install
  
after the pod is installed, you are ready to launch the app.

Run this command to launch the app:
npm start --clean-cache

Wait for a while if you already have launched an iOS simulator. If not, then open a new terminal window and run this command:
npm run ios
or if you want to run the code for a specific simulator and SDK version run the following command:
- npm run ios -- --simulator="iPhone 15 Pro Max (17.2)"
  
here iPhone 15 Pro Max is the device type and 17.2 is the SDK version


If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Xcode respectively.


## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Overview of the Project:

This project is for home automation application where users will be able to turn their electrical devices from their iOS or Android app. Users will be able to see and control if their home devices are turned or off. I have created the home screen only as per the instruction. There might be some miss allignment and difference of few labels and the font size. All the button functions are noted in to to do list which is commented out. As you will see, if you hit the buttons, it will post the alert of the corresponding ones. The big thing that I should have done is instead of a view I should have you FlatList for the switch board. Then the gap between the last row buttons wouldn't be there. SInce the mock up only contains 8 images, I didn't use the scrollview. But it would be something that should needed to be done in future develpment so that the users can scroll down for more switches.
